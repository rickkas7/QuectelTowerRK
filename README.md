# QuectelTowerRK

*Cellular tower information for Particle devices with Quectel cellular modems*

This library extracts the tracker_cellular.cpp and tracker_cellular.h files out of the [tracker_edge](https://github.com/particle-iot/tracker-edge) project and renames the class to be more generic.

It also adds blocking and callback methods, instead of requiring a fixed delay after calling startScan.
